# PerceptualAveragingRNN
This is a work in progress recurrent on-center off-surround neural network module intended to explore human perceptual averaging

1. To run the program just try the following from a matlab or octave terminal. All the .m files should be in the same folder where the command is to be run.
params = model_summary_stat;

2. Save the resulting variable params as a .mat file.

3. To change any simulation parameters see setParamsSummary.m file

4. To plot the results run  
new_summary_plot(<mat_file_name>)
